# A. Build Queuing classes
### a. Write 2 classes to implement the following IQueuable interface

    Interface IQueuable {
        //adds value to queue and returns new queue
        enqueue(value: string): string[];
        //removes item from queue, and returns the item removed
        dequeue(): string;
        //returns a list of all the items in the queue
        getQueue(): string[];
        //returns the number of items in the queue
        size():number;
    }

<p>Build your queues ontop of arrays; call your classes FIFOQUEUE and LIFOQUEUE (first-in first-out & last-in first-out) queues, or QUEUE and STACK, whichever names you prefer.</p>

### b. If you’ve written your enqueue and dequeue using array methods, how would you rewrite the same functions without using any array methods?

### c. Show how you would improve the design of your classes, apply various design patterns and techniques as you see fit
